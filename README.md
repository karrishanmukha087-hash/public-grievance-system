A complete, professional, secure, and responsive Public Grievance Portal where citizens can register, lodge complaints, track grievance progress through a live history timeline, and receive notification feeds. Administrators can manage complaints, departments, compile Excel/PDF reports, and analyze data through an analytics dashboard.

## ⚙️ How it Works on GitHub Pages
This website is deployed directly to **GitHub Pages**. Since GitHub Pages only hosts static content, a mock API layer (`public/js/mockApi.js`) intercepts all backend requests and handles database storage, session management, and notifications fully in your browser via `localStorage`.

* **All features work live**: You can register users, submit grievances, track timelines, change priorities, and compile reports.
* **Persistent locally**: All changes you make (lodged complaints, user profiles, status changes) are saved inside your browser's `localStorage` and will persist across refreshes.

To run with a real backend and a SQL database locally:
1. Clone the repository and run `npm install`.
2. Start the local server using `npm start` or `node server.js`.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
